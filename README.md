The World's Tiniest role-playing game.

A while back there was a craze on Facebook for completing quizzes. ("What kind of breakfast are you?" etc.)
I saw that and thought, I can make a game out of this.

This project is essentially a mutliple-choice quiz, but with the questions written to make it look like
a role-playing game (interactive fiction).
